I am a John Harvard Distinguished Science fellow based at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I received my PhD in 2019 from the University of Edinburgh.
My primary interest is the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, in particular the fuelling and quenching of star formation
at intermediate redshifts (z~1-3). I work on both large scales, probing galaxy environments via clustering, and small scales,
studying the spatially-resolved properties of individual galaxies. I use data from telescopes spanning many wavelengths,
from the ultraviolet with the Hubble Space Telescope to radio wavelengths with LOFAR. My research blends these observations 
with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as EAGLE and FIRE.
