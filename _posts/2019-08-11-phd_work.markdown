I began my PhD studying the role of environment in the evolution of star-forming galaxies, using data from HiZELS, an impressive near-infrared narrow-band survey that enables the identification of H-alpha emitters at z=0.8-2.2. 
My first couple of papers investigate the clustering of HiZELS galaxies, and relate this to their host dark matter haloes.

I have also worked on comparing observations to large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as EAGLE. In another paper, I used Principal Component Analysis to identify the key axes of correlation between halo mass, stellar mass and star-formation rate, for EAGLE galaxies at various redshifts.
