I began my PhD studying the role of environment in the evolution of star-forming galaxies, using data from HiZELS, an impressive near-infrared narrow-band survey that enables the identification of H-alpha emitters at z=0.8-2.2. 
My first couple of papers investigate the clustering of HiZELS galaxies, and relate this to their host dark matter haloes.

I'm interested in using comparing observations with large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as EAGLE. In another paper, I used Principal Component Analysis to identify the key axes of correlation between halo mass, stellar mass and star-formation rate, for EAGLE galaxies at various redshifts.
